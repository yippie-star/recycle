In Singapore, we love food. But sometimes, we order, cook or buy more than we need. This leads to food wastage. Every year, Singapore generates around 800 million kg of food waste! This is equivalent to more than 1500 Olympic-size swimming pools or 2 bowls of food per person per day. Food waste is generated from households, markets, hawker centres, supermarkets and food courts or other eating establishments. About 14% of the food waste in Singapore is recycled. The rest is incinerated and sent to the landfill. Singapore is a small country with limited space. At the rate we are producing waste, we will need a new incineration plant every 7-10 years, and a new landfill every 30 -35 years. The resources and labour used to produce the food also go to waste, along with hard-earned money we use to buy food. Every time we throw food away, part of our hard-earned money is wasted. When we order, buy and cook just enough, and properly store leftovers for use the next day, we save money. Tips for cooking at home: Keep track of what’s in your kitchen. Plan meals according to what you have, and what’s expiring soon. Cook just enough. Determine the amount to be cooked with the diners’ appetites and eating habits in mind. Use off-cuts or the equivalent. Off-cuts of meat and vegetable stems or roots can be used to make stocks. Citrus fruit rinds and zest can add flavour to other dishes. Share. Pack any excess food for your guests, friends or neighbours. Cook a “use-it-up” meal every week. Use only what’s already in your kitchen, including leftovers. Tips for Grocery Shopping. Check your kitchen before going grocery shopping. This prevents duplicate purchases. Plan your purchases ahead. Make a shopping list and keep to it. Look past the imperfections. Odd-looking, bruised and blemished fruits and vegetables can be trimmed and used for cooking.
